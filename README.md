NerdyIsBack Plugin Framework
============================
Current Version: 0.5

   The NerdyIsBack Plugin framework began as a collection of classes for
   managing custom post types, meta boxes, and taxonomies for WordPress.
   When I realized I was using the same four classes in almost every
   WordPress project I developed, I decided it was time to DRY things up a
   little. The NerdyIsBack Plugin Framework aims to build on the WordPress
   Plugin API (not replace it) and bring better support for
   object-oriented architecture to the plugin development process.

Objectives
----------

1. Ease object-oriented plugin development
2. Encourage separation of code
3. MVC implementation for WordPress administration panels
